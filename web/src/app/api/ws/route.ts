import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // WebSocket upgrade is handled by the custom server
  return new Response('WebSocket endpoint', { status: 200 })
}

// Note: For production WebSocket support in Next.js, you'll need to:
// 1. Create a custom server (e.g., server.js) that handles WebSocket connections
// 2. Or use a separate WebSocket server running on a different port
// 3. Or use services like Pusher, Ably, or Socket.io with their cloud offerings

// Example custom server setup would be in a separate file:
// server.js at the root of the web directory
